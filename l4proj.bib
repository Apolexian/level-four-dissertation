  url      = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07730},
  abstract = {Transport and security protocols are essential to ensure reliable and secure communication between two parties. For IoT applications, these protocols must be lightweight, since IoT devices are usually resource constrained. Unfortunately, the existing transport and security protocols -- namely TCP/TLS and UDP/DTLS -- fall short in terms of connection overhead, latency, and connection migration when used in IoT applications. In this paper, after studying the root causes of these shortcomings, we show how utilizing QUIC in IoT scenarios results in a higher performance. Based on these observations, and given the popularity of MQTT as an IoT application layer protocol, we integrate MQTT with QUIC. By presenting the main APIs and functions developed, we explain how connection establishment and message exchange functionalities work. We evaluate the performance of MQTTw/QUIC versus MQTTw/TCP using wired, wireless, and long-distance testbeds. Our results show that MQTTw/QUIC reduces connection overhead in terms of the number of packets exchanged with the broker by up to 56\%. In addition, by eliminating half-open connections, MQTTw/QUIC reduces processor and memory usage by up to 83\% and 50\%, respectively. Furthermore, by removing the head-of-line blocking problem, delivery latency is reduced by up to 55\%. We also show that the throughput drops experienced by MQTTw/QUIC when a connection migration happens is considerably lower than that of MQTTw/TCP.},

In this paper, we investigate the security of the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely adopted in IoT infrastructures. We exploit two specific weaknesses of MQTT, identified during our research activities, allowing the client to configure the KeepAlive parameter and MQTT packets to execute an innovative cyber threat against the MQTT broker. In order to validate the exploitation of such vulnerabilities, we propose SlowTT, a novel “Slow” denial of service attack aimed at targeting MQTT through low-rate techniques, characterized by minimum attack bandwidth and computational power requirements. We validate SlowTT against real MQTT services, by considering both plaintext and encrypted communications and by comparing the effects of the attack when targeting different application daemons and protocol versions. Results show that SlowTT is extremely successful, and it can exploit the identified vulnerability to execute a denial of service against the IoT network by keeping the connection alive for a long time.},

Recently its 5.0 version has been introduced and ensuring that it is capable of providing services in a secure manner is of great importance. It must be noted that holistic security analysis should also evaluate protocol’s susceptibility to network covert channels. That is why in this paper we present a systematic overview of potential data hiding techniques that can be applied to MQTT 5.0. We are especially focusing on network covert channels that, in order to exchange secrets, exploit characteristic features of this MQTT version. Finally, we develop proof-of-concept implementations of the chosen data hiding techniques and conduct their performance evaluation in order to assess their feasibility in practical setups.},

  abstract  = {Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack.},

  abstract   = {An end-to-end view of IoT security and privacy and a vulnerability analysis of the Edimax IP camera system, which is the first to exploit this system and has identified various attacks that can fully control all the cameras from the manufacturer. In this paper, we present an end-to-end view of IoT security and privacy and a case study. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we present our end-to-end view of an IoT system and this view can guide risk assessment and design of an IoT system. We identify 10 basic IoT functionalities that are related to security and privacy. Based on this view, we systematically present security and privacy requirements in terms of IoT system, software, networking and big data analytics in the cloud. Second, using the end-to-end view of IoT security and privacy, we present a vulnerability analysis of the Edimax IP camera system. We are the first to exploit this system and have identified various attacks that can fully control all the cameras from the manufacturer. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered attacks and raise the alarms again for the IoT manufacturers. Third, such vulnerabilities found in the exploit of Edimax cameras and our previous exploit of Edimax smartplugs can lead to another wave of Mirai attacks, which can be either botnets or worm attacks. To systematically understand the damage of the Mirai malware, we model propagation of the Mirai and use the simulations to validate the modeling. The work in this paper raises the alarm again for the IoT device manufacturers to better secure their products in order to prevent malware attacks like Mirai.},

@article{Shelby2014,
  abstract = {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrolers with small amount of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between applications endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained enviroments.},

  abstract = {In a false data injection attack (FDIA), an adversary stealthily compromises measurements from electricity grid sensors in a coordinated fashion, with a view to evading detection by the power system bad data detection module. A successful FDIA can cause the system operator to perform control actions that compromise either the physical or economic operation of the power system. In this letter, we consider some implications for FDIAs arising from the late 2015 Ukraine Blackout event.},
