The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance.

This paper represents the overview of Security principles, Security Threats and Security challenges at the application layer and its countermeasures to overcome those challenges. The Application layer plays an important role in all of the Internet of Thing applications. The most widely used application layer protocol is MQTT. The security threats for Application Layer Protocol MQTT is particularly selected and evaluated. Comparison is done between different Application layer protocols and security measures for those protocols. Due to the lack of common standards for IoT protocols, a lot of issues are considered while choosing the particular protocol.},

The network and application layers, based on the ZigBee 2007 PRO Standard, provide a convenient framework for component-based software that supports customer solutions from multiple vendors. This technology is supported by System-on-a-Chip solutions, resulting in extremely small and low-power nodes. The Wireless Connections in Space Project addresses the aerospace flight domain for both flight-critical and non-critical avionics. WSNs provide the inherent fault tolerance required for aerospace applications utilizing such technology. The team from Ames Research Center has developed techniques for assessing the fault tolerance of ZigBee WSNs challenged by radio frequency (RF) interference or WSN node failure.},

  title    = {Implementation and {Analysis} of {QUIC} for {MQTT}},
  url      = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07730},
  abstract = {Transport and security protocols are essential to ensure reliable and secure communication between two parties. For IoT applications, these protocols must be lightweight, since IoT devices are usually resource constrained. Unfortunately, the existing transport and security protocols -- namely TCP/TLS and UDP/DTLS -- fall short in terms of connection overhead, latency, and connection migration when used in IoT applications. In this paper, after studying the root causes of these shortcomings, we show how utilizing QUIC in IoT scenarios results in a higher performance. Based on these observations, and given the popularity of MQTT as an IoT application layer protocol, we integrate MQTT with QUIC. By presenting the main APIs and functions developed, we explain how connection establishment and message exchange functionalities work. We evaluate the performance of MQTTw/QUIC versus MQTTw/TCP using wired, wireless, and long-distance testbeds. Our results show that MQTTw/QUIC reduces connection overhead in terms of the number of packets exchanged with the broker by up to 56\%. In addition, by eliminating half-open connections, MQTTw/QUIC reduces processor and memory usage by up to 83\% and 50\%, respectively. Furthermore, by removing the head-of-line blocking problem, delivery latency is reduced by up to 55\%. We also show that the throughput drops experienced by MQTTw/QUIC when a connection migration happens is considerably lower than that of MQTTw/TCP.},
