Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise.},

The Internet of things (IoT) has recently become an important research topic because it integrates various sensors and objects to communicate directly with one another without human intervention. The requirements for the large-scale deployment of the IoT are rapidly increasing with a major security concern. This study focuses on the state-of-the-art IoT security threats and vulnerabilities by conducting an extensive survey of existing works in the area of IoT security. The taxonomy of the current security threats in the contexts of application, architecture, and communication is presented. This study also compares possible security threats in the IoT. We discuss the IoT security scenario and provide an analysis of the possible attacks. Open research issues and security implementation challenges in IoT security are described as well. This study aims to serve as a useful manual of existing security threats and vulnerabilities of the IoT heterogeneous environment and proposes possible solutions for improving the IoT security architecture.},

  abstract  = {The Internet of things aspires to connect anyone with anything at any point of time at any place. Internet of Thing is generally made up of three-layer architecture. Namely Perception, Network and Application layers. A lot of security principles should be enabled at each layer for proper and efficient working of these applications. This paper represents the overview of Security principles, Security Threats and Security challenges at the application layer and its countermeasures to overcome those challenges. The Application layer plays an important role in all of the Internet of Thing applications. The most widely used application layer protocol is MQTT. The security threats for Application Layer Protocol MQTT is particularly selected and evaluated. Comparison is done between different Application layer protocols and security measures for those protocols. Due to the lack of common standards for IoT protocols, a lot of issues are considered while choosing the particular protocol.},
