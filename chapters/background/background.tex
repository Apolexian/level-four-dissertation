\chapter{Background} \label{chap:back}

In this chapter, we present the background of topics that are fundamental for this work.
We examine the current developments in the networks transport layer, the constraints surrounding IoT devices, hardware constrained network protocols, the MQTT protocol and the Rust programming language.

We demonstrate why it is favourable to use QUIC as the transport layer protocol for IoT devices and how it can solve some of the challenges in designing protocols for hardware constrained devices.
Additionally, we explain why we have chosen Rust as the programming language of choice in the context of creating efficient, secure IoT firmware.
