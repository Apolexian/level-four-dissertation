    The standard protocols used to provide secure communication - TCP and TLS, often fall short for hardware constrained devices due to latency, connection overhead, head of line blocking and large hardware footprints.
    QUIC - a new transport layer protocol is set to succeed the TCP/TLS stack and is advantageous for performance and security by design.
    Due to the popularity of MQTT, a lightweight IoT protocol, in this work, we present MQuicTT - a QUIC based implementation of the MQTT protocol.
    We analyse the landscape of existing QUIC implementations that we considered to underlay MQuicTT, discuss our implementation of a socket API for QUIC and the implementation of MQuicTT itself.
    We also compare the performance of the resulting solution with existing MQTT implementations in various use cases.
    Finally, we find that TLS contributes a significant overhead to the binary size of QUIC implementations and discusses possible alternatives.
