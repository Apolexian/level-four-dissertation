\section{Binary size breakdown} \label{sec:binary_sizes}

We first look at an in-depth breakdown of the composition of the binary of the underlying QUIC implementation.
As previously established, hardware constrained devices do not have much space for firmware; hence, identifying sections of the QUIC stack that can be trimmed down or eliminated entirely is essential.

The resulting binary sizes after these steps can be found in Figure TBA.

As we can see, after trimming down the binary, the TLS implementation stands out as the most considerable dependency.
While~\cite{eggert_towards_2020} attempts to address this by creating minimal cypher implementations used by TLS, we instead opt to discuss the possibility of a complete alternative to TLS, suitable for hardware constrained devices in Section~\ref{chap:TLS}.
