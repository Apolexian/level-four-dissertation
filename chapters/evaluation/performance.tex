\section{Data transmission comparison}

We next evaluate the time it took both implementations to transmit the aforementioned MQTT messages.
To do so, we have used the previously described methodology.

Based on the analysis of connection time and the previous discussion, we hypothesise that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1}: $MQuicTT$ performs on-par with $rumqtt$ in the IoT home scenario but does not present a significant difference.
    \item \textbf{H2}: $MQuicTT$ performs significantly better than $rumqtt$ in the printer farm scenario.
    \item \textbf{H3}: $MQuicTT$ can transmit all the messages on all data links in the synthetic scenario, whereas $rumqtt$ is not.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:comm_time} shows the results of this experiment.

    \caption{The time it took for the implementations to transmit the MQTT messages.
        The base $rumqtt$ implementation is shown in green and $MQuicTT$ in orange.
        Each column represents a scenario, and each row is a data link.
        The time for each Figure is shown in milliseconds. The base implementation of $rumqtt$ could not transmit data in the synthetic packet loss scenario.}
    \label{fig:comm_time}
\end{figure}

We can see that the results support hypothesis \textbf{H1}.
That is,  $MQuicTT$ performs almost identically to $rumqtt$ across all data links for the IoT home scenario.
In fact, $MQuicTT$ actually performs marginally better than $rumqtt$ in this scenario with the transmission time of $MQuicTT$ being on average $2.02\%$ lower than that of $rumqtt$.
From this we can see that $MQuicTT$ presents no disadvantages in terms of transmission time even in network with low packet loss and congestion.

Hypothesis \textbf{H2} however is not supported.
The performance advantage in terms of transmission time for $MQuicTT$ in the printer farm scenario is almost identical to that of the smart home scenario.
On average, $MQuicTT$ transmits the data $2.36\%$ faster than $rumqtt$ and although this is an improvement, it is comparable to the improvement in the IoT home scenario.

The result means that the presented use-case does not present a high enough packet loss percentage for $MQuicTT$ to have a significant advantage.
This can be verified by looking at the synthetic scenario, which validates hypothesis \textbf{H3}.
In the synthetic scenario only $MQuicTT$ managed to transmit the data on all data links and transmitted the data $13.8\%$ faster using ethernet.
Hence, in environments that may experience extreme data loss, $MQuicTT$ presents a clear advantage, however, finding such a scenario may be difficult.

Overall, $MQuicTT$ transmitted the data faster than $rumqtt$ across all scenarios and has shown to be more resilient against high packet loss.
It may however be ineffective overhead to migrate existing deployments to it due to the marginal benefits in low congestion environments.
