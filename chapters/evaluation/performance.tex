\section{MQTT/QUIC performance comparison}

We next evaluate the performance of MQuicTT compared to other popular MQTT implementations.
To do so, we have used the scenarios as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:net_sim} and have transmitted the message 100 times for each scenario.
The results of this experiment can be found in Figure TBA.
