\chapter{Analysis} \label{chapter:eval}

Having defined the testing environment that is used for the analysis, we will now describe an outline of the analysis methodology.

In order to analyse how MQuicTT answers the previously stated research questions, we have identified objectives that each have a section in this chapter.
The rationale behind each objective will be discussed at the start of the corresponding section, followed by a demonstration of the results and their discussion.
