\chapter{Foundational implementations}\label{chap:libs}

This chapter presents the rationale behind our choice of QUIC and MQTT implementations.
In terms of QUIC, we used the $quinn$ implementation in order to create the intermediate library discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:quic_socket}.
On the MQTT side, $rumqtt$ was used as the starting point for our MQTT/QUIC implementation.

The choice criteria follow from the previously presented background and some general criteria.
We analysed the available implementations based on their storage footprint, the programming language they were implemented in, their use of TLS, widespread adoption and availability of documentation.
